# Custom-Producer-app

Big data messaging with Kafka

We have designed two custom producer named CustomProducer and Twitter Producer.
Custom Producer : Generates random string of length n
Twitter Producer: Fetch all the post from provided page name

 1. Start the consumer
 > cd Custom-Producer-app\KafkaAPIClient
 > mvn clean compile assembly:single
 > java -cp target/KafkaAPIClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Consumer test group1
 
 2. Start the Producer
  To start custom producer 
  > Open command prompt
  > Run "runp.bat"
  
  
  To start twitter producer 
  > Open command prompt
  > Run "run-twitter-producer.bat"

3. Producer window will show the generated strings.

4. Verify the messages are output by the Consumer.
